I have adapted them to be more verbose, use notation consistent with [Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://mml-book.github.io/) and add some colour. I've also repeated some of the documentation pertaining to the `minimize` module [from the SciPy docs](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.minimize.html)."
