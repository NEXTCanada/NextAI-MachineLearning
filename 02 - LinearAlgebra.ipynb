    "Either way, the matrix equation $A\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}$ is an almost ubiquitous problem whose solution comes up again and again in theoretical derivations and in practical data analysis problems. One of the most important applications is the minimization of quadratic energy functions: if $A$ is symmetric positive definite then the quadratic form $\\mathbf{x}^TA\\mathbf{x} - 2 \\mathbf{x}^T\\mathbf{b} + c$ is *minimized* at the point where $A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}$. Such quadratic forms arise often in the study of linear models with Gaussian noise since the log likelihood of data under such models is always a matrix quadratic.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's first consider the case of a single $\\mathbf{x}$. As noted above, geometrically we can think of the rows of the system as encoding constraint surfaces in which the solution vector $\\mathbf{x}$ must lie and what we are looking for is the point(s) at which these surfaces intersect. Of course, there may be no solution satisfying the equation; then we typically need some way to pick the \"best\" approximate solution. The constraints may also intersect along an entire line or surface in which case there are an infinity of solutions; once again we would like to think about which one might be best.\n",

    "We can take things one step further to get around this problem. The answer is to ask for the *minimum norm* vector $\\mathbf{x}$ that still minimizes the above error.

    "Now consider what happens if we have many vectors $\\mathbf{x}_i$ and $\\mathbf{b}_i$, all of which we want to satisfy the equation $A \\mathbf{x}_i = \\mathbf{b}_i$. If we stack the vectors $\\mathbf{x}_i$ beside each other as the columns of a large matrix $X$ and do the same for $\\mathbf{b}_i$ to form $B$, we can write the problem as a large matrix equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$AX = B$$\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two things we could do here. If, as before, $A$ is known, we could find $X$ given $B$. To do this, we would just need to apply the techniques described above to solve the system $A \\mathbf{x}_i = \\mathbf{b}_i$ independently for each column $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if we were given *both* $X$ and $B$ we could try to find a *single* $A$ which satisfies the equations. In essense, we are fitting a linear function given its inputs $X$ and corresponding outputs $B$. This problem is called *linear regression*. Usually we add a row of ones to $X$ to fit an affine function (i.e. one with an offset).\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, there are only very few cases in which there exists an $A$ which exactly satisfies the equations (if there is, $X$ will be square and invertible). However, we can set things up the same way as before and ask for the *least-squares* $A$ which minimizes:\n",

    "$$ A^* = BX^T\\left(XX^T\\right)^{-1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Once again, we might have invertibility problems in $XX^T$, this corresponds to having fewer equations than unknowns in our linear system (or duplicated equations), thus leaving some of the elements in $A$ unconstrained. We can get around this in the same way as with linear least squares by adding a small amount of penalty on the norm of the elements of $A$.\n",

    "$$E = \\sum_i ||A \\mathbf{x}_i - \\mathbf{b}_i||^2 + \\epsilon ||A||^2$$\n",

    "\n",
    "which is known as *ridge regression*. Often it is a good idea to use a small nonzero value of $\\epsilon$ even if $XX^T$ is technically invertible, because this gives more stable solutions by penalizing large elements of $A$ that aren't doing much to reduce the error. In neural networks, this is known as *weight decay*, and in general, is known as *regularization*. You can also interpret it as having a Gaussian prior with mean zero and variance $1/2\\epsilon$ on each element of $A$.\n",
